# App 

## Repo

The repo is hosted on [github](https://github.com/gomaa0/Earthquake-Zen-Garden)

`git clone git@github.com:gomaa0/Earthquake-Zen-Garden.git`

## Production

The app is deployed [here](https://unruffled-yalow-bc0888.netlify.app/). 


## Branches - VIP

The app is built with different bundlers on different branches:

- *main* branch => parcel
- *webpack* branch => webpack 5

## Folder structure and flow

- React does recommend those
  [file structure styles](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-structure.html). I do
  lean towards grouping by feature, while allowing top level *shared* files such as
  general utils, services, api ...etc
